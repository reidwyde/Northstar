add to writing list:
- Writing the ignoble lie
About how everyone has that thing that stops them from believing they can be something. The people of Thebes had the noble lie. My dad believes that since his dad died when he was 12, that life just hasn't gone correctly.
For me, the ignoble lie was that my parents are different religions.
It's this thing that we use to say that other people have it better off than us
- Writing the luckiest guy in the world
How it's important to believe that you are the luckiest person. How that is a better story and more real. (Truth being the Greek version of truth. The unfading/unforgetable/better story).
- Writing - the different kinds of knowledge necessitate that God experience life as a person. For God to know everything it would mean that God has even carnal knowledge and knowledge of what it means to be tempted. And also so that God could have true empathy with every person. God could truly know what every person goes through. So god is truly connected to each of us and has a relationship built on real understanding with each of us.
- Writing - every tribe every tongue. To the Greeks, Jesus is a demigod. To the hebrews, Jesus is messiah and (is the same role as) the angel of the lord.
- Writing - psalm 23 is about Jesus passing though death and then being anointed in heaven. How the word is not olam at the end but xxx yamim. A fullness of days. All the days. A completeness of days. Vs olam, which means until who knows, until the horizon
- Writing: friends as decentralized computers. If a lot of people like you it's easy to be like "why doesn't that guy like me" but the point of decentralized computers is there are usually bad nodes

- add to writing list 
Writing everytime you use the phone you're engaging in the prisoners dilemma. People say things on the phone that they would never in a million years say in real life. At any time they can choose to show you things that are awful.
You can be having a convo with someone and they just stop responding. They could send you a message at an inconvenient time. In real life, communication is a prisoners dilemma too but the cost of defecting is high because yelling at people is generally unacceptable and just refusing to speak is also considered unacceptable.

Writing: the Bible tells as a narrative the psychological transition of a mind about the nature of God. You begin with the first thoughts you can have about God, that he did in fact create the universe, and you end with the final thought you can have about God, which is that he will simultaneously bring about ultimate justice while also delivering mercy and rest to the multitudes.
In the middle, God transitions from being the hero of one people to the hero of all people. This reflects our own understanding of what the universal God must necessarily be. For he created everyone, so he must have some level of familial love for all peoples. We extend our sense of empathy beyond our own tribe to the universal.
How could the Bible be anything else? It is supposed to be the book by which all people understand Gods character.
So the Bible is not a book which describes a changing character of God. It's a book which describes the evolving character of a human mind and tells that character as if it was a narrative.
The narrative has an infancy Genesis
A youth Davidic Israel
An anxious maturity (systematic limitation is realized, yearning for youth sets in) exile, late Israel
A peaceful maturity which hopes the younger generation will do what he did not, the gospel, the epistles
A dissolution of the ego, an incredible dream of the future, revelation

Writing is was and is to come
All the spiritual realities did happen at cavalry, will happen on the last day, and are happening today. (Already, not yet, AND are)



writing - a better way to tax billionaires?
Consider taxation during the bezos style loan cycle
Maybe tax the loan dispensation but make the repayment tax deductible
Is there some kind of similarity to how real estate is dealt with?
How does the stock price go up but the earnings are balanced? Does it truly make no profit


Writing something about dad opening the door for the old people but he was late to dinner.

Writing "the transmutation of all things"
How when you believe in God, every lucky break is a miracle granted by God and every unlucky break is God showing you that his will diverges from yours a bit regarding his ultimate glory. So all things are imbued with meaning, converted from some base material into shining, shining gold.

Writing idea:
An orouboros universi
Each universe creates the next one
And the last one creates the first
?how might the last one create the first?
Visual metaphor of blocks which are stacked in a circle and they don't fall down

Writing
"Tacking into the wind"
Or
"Fighting the current"
God's wind of good desires to push us in its natural direction, but by all manner of clever schemes and devices we might gradually make towards the other way, tacking left and right, carving a crooked path to perdition.
